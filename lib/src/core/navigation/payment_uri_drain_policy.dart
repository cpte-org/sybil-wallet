/// to `/send`, so there is nothing to interrupt: the swap review and the
/// migration steps stay exactly where they were until the user answers the
/// card. The rows that remain are the ones about whether the request can be
/// shown at all — no wallet, mid-onboarding, locked, stale, or a wallet that
/// failed to load — plus the two surfaces that would lose something if a card
/// went over them: a hardware signing session, and a broadcast still running
/// on `/send/status`.
