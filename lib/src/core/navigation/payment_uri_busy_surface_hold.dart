/// The one way a surface takes a `paymentUriBusySurfaceProvider` hold.
///
/// Every holder owes the notifier the same contract — acquire once from a
/// post-frame callback after mount, give exactly that hold back from
/// `dispose` via `releaseAfterNavigation`, and guard both ends with a
/// per-holder bit so a surface disposed before its callback ran cannot
/// decrement a hold it never took.
///
/// The post-frame acquire is early enough only because the drain in
/// `app.dart` runs *after* every post-frame callback of a frame
/// (`WidgetsBinding.endOfFrame`), not as one of them: a link that arrives in
/// the same turn as the navigation that mounts a holder schedules its drain
/// before this `initState` runs, and a drain that was itself a post-frame
/// callback would run first and read a count of zero. Writing that by hand in a dozen Keystone
/// screens is how one of them ends up releasing twice, so the pattern lives
/// here once.
///
/// Two shapes, because the surfaces come in two shapes:
///
/// * [PaymentUriBusySurfaceHoldMixin] for a screen whose whole lifetime is
///   the protected session (`/send/keystone/scan`, the mobile signing screens).
/// * [PaymentUriBusySurfaceHold] for a QR that is only part of a longer-lived
///   screen — the desktop send review and the voting status screen show one
///   mid-flow, and the hold must last exactly as long as that subtree, not as
///   long as the review.
